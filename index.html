                <h5>History of CSS</h5>
                <p>CSS was created by Norweigian web pioneer, Håkon Wium Lie. 
                    It was first proposed on October 10, 1994, as a styling language to help solve problems with HTML 4. 
                    Other styling languages were proposed at the same time, such<br>as Style Sheets for HTML and JSSS.

                    <p>Håkon Wium Lie is currently working at CERN, 
                        which was starting to be used as a platform for electronic publishing but was missing a crucial part: they had no way to style their documents. 
                        After a series of in-depth discussions on making web pages look the proposal for CSS was presented at the Web conference in Chicago in November 1994. </p>

                    <p> The first CSS version was released in August 1996, with only Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3 supporting it. 
                        The next browser to support CSS was Netscape Navigator, version 4.0. After long battles within the HTML ERB, 
                        CSS Level 1 was finally released as a W3C recommendation in December 1996.</p>

                    <p>CSS 2 was released, developed by W3C. CSS2 is a subset of CSS1 and has enhanced capabilities that the the previous one didnt have: 
                        Media types concent and Aural style sheets. After the release of CSS2, the work for CSS3 was started.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p> CSS3 was released, which included presentation-style properties that allowed users to create a presentation from a document. 
                    Unlike its predecessor, CSS2, it allowed developers to divide their code into individual modules, which makes the coding easier. Each module dealt with a relatively small subset of the overall specification, and either added new features or refined and extended existing features. 
                    All additions and enhancements to the specification were written in order to be backward-compatible with older versions of CSS. </p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p> CSS 2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned elements, 
                        more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new calculation of the 'clip' property), 
                        and adds a few highly requested features which have already been widely implemented. But most of all CSS 2.1 represents a "snapshot" of CSS usage: 
                        it consists of all CSS features that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation.</p>
